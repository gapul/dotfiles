# Geyser standalone: the Bedrock-to-Java protocol translator that lets phones, consoles and
# Windows 10 Edition players join the Java server. It runs as its own daemon in front of lazymc
# (nix/hosts/macmini.nix), so a Bedrock connection wakes the sleeping server like a Java one.
# The download API publishes a sha256 per build, so scripts/update-custom-packages.ts can move
# this pin to the newest build without downloading anything.
